## Directory
the important code for the unet is on ```unet_train.py```

the other codes are for setting up the images directories as well as test the model and evaluations

## Where the model?
I did nt uploaded the trained model bc of filesize limitations

## Enviorment
I did use a very old version of Tensorflow, i think it might work in recent versions without serious modifications needed:

tensorboard               1.14.0                   py37_0    conda-forge
tensorflow                1.14.0          gpu_py37h74c33d7_0  
tensorflow-base           1.14.0          gpu_py37he45bfe2_0  
tensorflow-estimator      1.14.0           py37h5ca1d4c_0    conda-forge
tensorflow-gpu            1.14.0               h0d30ee6_0
